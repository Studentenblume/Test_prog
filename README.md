ATM machine

As owners of AwesomeSuperPuperBank, we want to upgrade our simple prototype of our new ATM machine that allows our customers to:


view their account balance
withdraw money


in upgraded version we allow our customers to:


deposit money to their account balance
work with multiple currencies
transfer money from one user to another


Our bank already has several clients. We saved their account information in our system (see config.yml).
The bank also has liquid assets (i.e. cash) in the amount of 4337 UAH (in different banknotes) which our ATM machine can operate with.
